- Maybe just merge player logic and animation separations together??
- Also separate jump and fall into two sprites with their own anims (non-looping)
	- This allows smoother transition frames

- Ok so apparently GMS does not have non-looping stuff so you will have to write your own animation handling script
	- gl lol

- par_ objects should only be used as labels and no actual code should be placed inside
    - This would not be necessary if C# interfaces existed augh

- instead of global.camera, maybe make general camera functions in a script, and then those functions call obj_Manager.camera??
