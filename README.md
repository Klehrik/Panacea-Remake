![Showcase of Panacea Remake](https://github.com/Klehrik/Panacea-Remake/assets/78520710/cd017bd8-9baa-43de-898d-09082a9cd93d)


A remake (sequel?) to [Panacea](https://klehrik.itch.io/panacea).  
I'm still really liking all the visual stuff I did here (Celeste being the main inspiration for this of course).

The font used is a slightly edited version of Theoretical by [somepx](https://somepx.itch.io/) (support their work [here](https://somepx.itch.io/humble-fonts-tiny)!)
