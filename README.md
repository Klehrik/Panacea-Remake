![Showcase of Panacea Remake](https://github.com/Klehrik/Panacea-Remake/assets/78520710/cd017bd8-9baa-43de-898d-09082a9cd93d)


A remake (sequel?) to [Panacea](https://klehrik.itch.io/panacea).  
I'm still really liking all the visual stuff I did here (Celeste being the main inspiration for this of course), but I ended up falling off the project because I wasn't sure where I wanted to take it.  
I may revisit this in the future though.

The font used is a slightly edited version of Theoretical by [somepx](https://somepx.itch.io/) (support their work [here](https://somepx.itch.io/humble-fonts-tiny)!)  
I also used the [Input](https://offalynne.github.io/Input/#/6.1/) library.

### Controls

Arrows/WASD - Move; hold down in the air to fast fall  
X/K - Flap; hold in the air to glide  
C/J - Breathe fire  
R - Reset  
F - Fullscreen  
LMB - Teleport around (for testing)
Space - Extend the head feathers (lol)

- Controller works as well I think
